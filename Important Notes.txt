Exception :-
`````````
Throws:-
``````
The Java throws keyword is used to declare an exception. It gives an information to the programmer that there may occur an exception.
So, it is better for the programmer to provide the exception handling code so that the normal flow of the program can be maintained.
Rule: If we are calling a method that declares an exception, we must either caught or declare the exception.

There are two cases:-
````````````````````
Case 1: We have caught the exception i.e. we have handled the exception using try/catch block.
Case 2: We have declared the exception i.e. specified throws keyword with the method.
