What is ECS and ECR in AWS?
     The primary difference between Amazon ECR and ECS is that while ECR provides the repository that stores all 
code that has been written and packaged as a Docker image, the ECS takes these files and actively uses them in the 
deployment of applications.

Why is Amazon ECR used?
     Amazon ECR is a fully managed container registry offering high-performance hosting, so you can reliably deploy 
application images and artifacts anywhere.
